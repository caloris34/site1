<!-- Peru (no Huaraz) -->

<div>

    With a handful two months in front of me, I decided to spend them in one country on my wishlist: Peru.
    With at heart the idea of knowing culture in Andes mountains, I split the time available in two: one month to visit
    the "classic" Peru, hit by most tourist, and one month to live traditional life in Huaraz.
    A made a dedicated post on my experience in Huaraz and you can find it \link\ here.

    The decision of focusing on the "sierra" (mountainous) region of Peru revealed useful. For what I heard, the whole
    country is worth visiting, but traveling time between "la costa" (coast) and "la selva" (Amazon forest) can be
    considerable, up to many days!

    Following one of the most classical round trip, my first month in Peru included the cities of Lima, Cusco, Puno and
    Arequipa. The oasis village of Ica (between Lima and Arequipa) is also chosen by many travelers.
