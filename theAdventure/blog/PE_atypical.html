    Peru is by far one of my favorite countries.
    Since the first hours after arriving in Lima, I couldn't but hear other backpackers talking of the same places: Cusco, Arequipa, Puno, Ica.
    Well, the country has a lot more (and better!) to offer than that!
    But even by visiting the latter cities, you can make unique and local experiences. 
    

    <!-- Cusco -->
    A 2 hours flight from Lima, deep in the Andes, lies the old Incan imperial city of Cusco.
    There is also an 18 hours bus if you are on a budget with a lot of time and immunity to road sickness!

    The amount of activities this city can offer are endless: exploring the Valle Sagrado and Inca ruins, among which Machu Picchu, hiking to over 5000 meters of altitude or just enjoying the city with some shopping of local handicraft and delicious food.
    
    People are among the friendliest I met in the whole country, there wasn't a cab driver who didn't start chatting with me (in Spanish)!

    Thanks to Couchsurfing, I also shared some great time with locals Ciro!


    I stayed in the region for around 10 days and felt I did nothing there, so don't hesitate to stay as long as you can.

    In <a href="PE_Cusco.html">this post</a> I detailed my experiences in Cusco, but if all you want to know about is Machu Picchu, that is <a href="PE_MachuPicchu.html">here</a> !

    And don't forget that Cusco is at 3400 meters of altitude! I am used to be in the mountains, but I must insist that you WILL feel the altitude, be it with tiredness, headache, less appetite or more severe health problems. So take it easy the first 2-3 days and buy some coca leaves or candies!

    <!-- Puno -->
    After a night bus from Cusco, I arrived in the mystical city of Puno.
    Thanks to a lucky meeting in a collectivo in the Sacred Valley, I had the sweet local Yesii as my personal guide in Puno. 
    I arrived in Puno for sunrise over the lake, with some astonishing colors, for then quickly board a boat towards Amantani island. There, Yesii organized a two nights stay in a local family, the only way to sleep over in the island.
    The atmosphere is completely relaxed, locals work in the fields, with animals or other manual works, aside of welcoming few tourists per day eager to discover this untouched reality.
    Most people stay one night in Amantani and the following in the neighbor island Taquile, but I definitely suggest to stay 2 or more nights in the same island to have the time to fully appreciate it!
    There is a lovely hiking path all around the island which is barely flat and will keep you busy half a day. Again, don't underestimate altitude, the island is at 4000 meters above sea level!!



    <!-- Arequipa -->
    Randomly met the friendly doctor Milagros, who hosted me in AQP.

    Adobo arequipeno, with location. Starting around 9.30/10 am!! Not many places offer it during the week, it's a sunday meal.

    Colca canyon hike, oasis...


    <!-- Huaraz -->
    All travelers I met during the first month in Peru knew the latter destinations. The loop Cusco - Puno - Arequipa - Ica (done in either direction) is very common. When I was telling them I was going to Huaraz, most replied "where?". But those who knew and all the Peruvians I spoke with, replied "wow amazing, you will love it!".

    That was it, Huaraz is a magical place.
    At 3000 meters altitude in the Ancash region, a night bus away north from Lima, Huaraz and its 150.000 people live in the Cordillera Blanca.

    Mountains are everywhere around you, in any direction you will look at, and with most probability you will see Huascaran, the highest mountain of Peru at 6800 meters.
