    <h2>The Blanco Expedition</h2>
    <h3>For those always aiming at higher peaks</h3>
    In one week time, you will get to know the basics about rock climbing, glacier walking, rappeling and more.
    Due to the technicality of the activities, your small group will be always accompanied by a certified mountain guide (justifying the higher price...)
    In your first day in Huaraz, you will acclimate with some rock climbing nearby the city Los Olivos, a short hike to test your preparation and preparation of technical gear with our local partners.

    A briefing about the chosen expeditions will conclude the day. Please note that due to weather conditions, the proposed itinerary can vary. 

    2 days and one night, your first glacier expedition.

    1 day rest, more rock climbing or chill!

    3 days and two nights, yet another glacier!
